Pizza Builder
=============

A browser JavaScript and DOM manipulation exercise.

Based on [css3pizza](http://codepen.io/dsmoore/full/fiwAl)
by [Derek S. Moore](http://dereksmoore.com).

We've got the munchies for a nice, fresh pie of pizza.
Of course, we want to order online.
After all, talking to a person will only delay the consumption of pizza.
There's only one problem: our local pizzeria's pizza builder **isn't working**.
This time,
the local pizzeria is in luck because their customer today is a Web developer.
We always hear about how developers should give back to their community.
I can't think of a more meaningful contribution
than helping the community get pizza more easily.

Taking a look at their pizza builder,
it seems like their JavaScript file, `pizza.js`, is empty.
They must have ran out of money before the developer delivered their JavaScript.
Let's help them out by writing the pizza builder's JavaScript.
